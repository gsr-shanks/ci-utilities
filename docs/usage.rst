        ipa-tests.tar

This command archives the git repo and then downloads the content in a tar
format. There maybe repos which are huge in size, in such situations it makes
perfect sense to use the git archive protocol.

This command downloads all the builds attached to a specific erratum. The
--errata-loc is optional here, by default, the location is picked from the
build_download_loc of errata section in conf.

        x86_64 --loc /tmp/brew-builds

This command downloads the build as per the options specified. Irrespective of
which arch you provide noarch is downloaded by default. Instead of
commandline, all this options can be mentioned in the conf as well.
