* `restraint`_:

beaker
------

::

    [beaker]
    username = root
    password = whatever

This section supports username and password only. This username and password are
the credentials for your test resources. It is expected that all test
resources have a common username and password.


jenkins
-------

::

    [jenkins]
    job_name = 
    workspace = 
    existing_nodes = 
    jenkins_master_url = https://idm-qe-jenkins.ci.redhat.com

To start off, values for job_name, workspace, existing_nodes are empty. The
values are updated in the conf during runtime depending on Jenkins job. All 
these values are extracted from environment variables of the Jenkins job.

**Note:** If nexus is executed manually outside of Jenkins, then it is
expected that you export job_name, workspace and existing_nodes into the
environment or manually edit the conf file with appropriate values.

Since every job in Jenkins is unique, a lot depends on the job_name.


git
---

::

    [git]
    git_project = ipa-tests
    git_repo_url = git://git.redhat.com/ipa-tests.git
    git_get_branch = ci
    git_test_branch = default
    git_tar_out = ipa-tests.tar

Nexus git plugin uses git archive protocol to get the content in a .tar
format from git_get_branch. git_tar_out value is the name of the tar file.
Once the content is available, then it is untar'ed as git_project. 

This addresses the use case where your git repository is huge and you do not
intend to clone it everytime for few CI related files.

git_test_branch is used to update the fetch URL in restraint xml's. 'default'
leaves the restraint xml untouched, else the branch is appended in fetch URL.


errata
------

::

    [errata]
    xmlrpc_url = http://err.redhat.com/xmlrpc
    download_devel = http://download.devel.redhat.com
    mount_base = /mnt/redhat
    build_download_loc = /tmp/errata-builds

As of now, this section entirely is to support the command line usage.


brew
----

::

    [brew]
    brew_root = http://download.redhat.com/brewroot
    brew_hub = http://brew.redhat.com/brewhub
    brew_builds = 
        ipa, sssd, pki-core, 389-ds-base, bind, bind-dyndb-ldap, nss,
        python-yubico, certmonger, python-nss, python-dns, nspr, samba
    brew_tag = rhel-7.1-candidate
    brew_arch = x86_64
    build_download_loc = /tmp/brew-builds

brew_root is used to contruct a downloadable URL of the brew builds provided 
in brew_builds. All the builds are downloaded parallely using threads. brew_tag 
and brew_arch are the values you need to provide as per your job or requirement.

By default, noarch rpm's are downloaded along with the arch provided at brew_arch.
The default download location of brew builds is /tmp/brew-builds which can be 
overwritten using the command line option as mentioned in "Command line usage" 
section of this documentation. 




async_repos
-----------

::
        
    [async_repos]
    7.1 = http://blah.redhat.com/nightly/latest-RHEL-7/Server/x86_64/os/


The above section is checked and used only if 'z-candidate' is found in
brew-tag of CI_MESSAGE.

nexus checks for the platform version on the test resources. '7.1' if found in
platform version, then a .repo is created for the test resource that matched
and then is copied over to /etc/yum.repos.d



triggers
--------

::

    [triggers]
    ipa-user-cli = ipa-user-cli-rhel71-x86_64-trigger
    ipa-group-cli = ipa-group-cli-rhel71-x86_64-trigger
    ipa-hbac-func = ipa-hbac-func-rhel71-x86_64-trigger
    ipa-password = ipa-password-rhel71-x86_64-trigger
    ipa-dns = ipa-dns-rhel71-x86_64-trigger

This section uses jenkins python api to trigger jobs from nexus cli.

restraint
---------

::

    [restraint]
    remove_rpm = rhts-python
    install_rpm = restraint staf restraint-rhts
    job_xml_loc = ipa-tests/restraint
    6.7 = http://blah.redhat.com/~bpeck/restraint/el6.repo
    7.2 = http://blah.redhat.com/~bpeck/restraint/el7.repo
    20 = http://blah.redhat.com/~bpeck/restraint/fc20.repo

nexus uninstall rpms provided at remove_rpm and installs rpms provided at
install_rpm. Restraint repo needs to be copied before installing the rpms,
hence, based on the platform version the .repo file is copied over to the test
resource.

job_xml_loc is the location where you store all your restraint xml jobs. This
is to avoid mentioning the base path name everytime.


restraint_jobs
--------------

::

    [restraint_jobs]
    ipa-adtrust-rhel71-x86_64-bkr-runtest = ipa-adtrust-rhel71-x86_64-bkr.xml
    ipa-sudo-rhel71-x86_64-bkr2-runtest = ipa-sudo-rhel71-x86_64-bkr.xml
    ipa-user-cli-rhel71-x86_64-bkr-runtest = ipa-user-cli-rhel71-x86_64-bkr.xml
    ipa-hbac-func-rhel71-x86_64-bkr3-runtest = ipa-hbac-func-rhel71-x86_64-bkr3.xml
    ipa-password-rhel71-x86_64-bkr-runtest = ipa-password-rhel71-x86_64-bkr.xml

restraint_jobs section maps the Jenkins environments' JOB_NAME to the
restraint xml located in restraint sections job_xml_loc. Nexus gets the job
name from enrionment variable and looks for the appropriate restraint xml
file. 

Cheat: You may skip mapping JOB_NAME to restraint xml in this section by
exporting environment variable as WHAT_TEST="restraint xml file name"
