About
=====

Nexus was first created as a tool to bridge the gap between CI and QE test
automation. However, as it evolved, it took the shape of a tool that could be
used by others with their custom config and perform tasks using multiple other 
tools using a single command line. 

**USP:** Nexus can be used either in a CI environment or as a standalone tool.
