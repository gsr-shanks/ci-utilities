Nexus
=====

Nexus was first created as a tool to bridge the gap between CI and QE test 
automation. However, as it evolved, it took the shape of a tool that could
be used by others with their custom config and perform tasks using multiple 
other tools with a single command line.

In short, Nexus is designed to connect multiple tools and test frameworks for 
any pre-requisities, tasks or post requirements with Jenkins. Nexus can also 
be executed using its commandline interface.
